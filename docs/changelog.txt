Changelog for txtSQL
==================================================
August 2, 2004 ( txtSQL 2.2 Final )
  - Added function query_count()
  - Added function last_insert_id()
  - Removed warning when no values would be given to enter into table
  - When creating a database or a table, they directories/files are automatically CHMOD'd to 0755
    so that file permission errors are minimal
  - txtSQL requires that a column be present at all time in a table. This check was not enforced 
    when dropping a column (when there was only one left), so now it exists
  - The 'r_trim' and 'l_trim' functions now work properly
  - The 'permanent' attribute only comes into effect onyl when changing a value in that column,
    not the column definition itself
  - When creating a table, txtSQL now checks for a valid primary key ( that it is an integer and is
    auto_increment )
  - When dropping a database and it was locked, txtSQL would drop it anyway; this is not fixed
  - Added two new functions, db_exists() and table_exists()
  - Added the 'DISTINCT' feature, where you can specify a column that should be checked for duplicates
  - When using the '?' operator in the where clause and not specifying a search value, txtSQL now
    issues an error, and returns FALSE
  - Bug 967606: Integer fields would not be properly quoted in some cases internally
  - When deleting, and no 'where clause' is specified, all rows are deleted simultaneously, rather
    than the one by one method

  - If a primary key is set, and then the column is set to another field type then integer, it will
    not be a primary key anymore
  - You can modify a column definitions even if the field is permanent now. Permanent disallows the
    modification of that row's column if the field is set to permanent however
  - Added file locks to increase security when using file pointers in php
  - Added functionality to lock, and unlock a database
  - Insert, Update, Delete, Create Table, Alter Table, Drop Table, Drop Database, and Rename Database
    all now require that the database be unlocked in order to function

    it is now set to 0 (infinite)

February 24, 2004 (txtSQL 2.1.0 Beta)
  - Bug 905665: The create_tbl.php error that occurred when creating a table has been fixed
  - Modified the searching algorithm to increase execution speed, which resulted in a drop of
    a few tenths of a second per query (rougly 134% increase in speed)
  - In the update(), the limit was defaulted to one less than the number of records in the table;
    This is wrong, it is now set to the number of records in the table
  - Spelling fixes in update() and insert() when a maximum value for a column is exceeded
  - When checking that the fields maximum value is not exceeded, txtSQL now checks for an integer's
    value instead of the string length when inserting/updating
  - When inserting/selecting/updating rows with a "'" present in the string, it didnt addedslashes()
    properly; This is now fixed
